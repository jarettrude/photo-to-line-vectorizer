# Ruff configuration overrides for extension system
# 
# The extension system uses specific naming conventions:
# - EXT_* for extension modules and classes (e.g., EXT_Vectorize)
# - PRV_* for provider modules and classes (e.g., PRV_ImageTracer)
#
# These conventions enable auto-discovery and are intentional.

[lint]
# Allow EXT_* and PRV_* naming patterns
ignore = [
    "N801",  # Class name should use CapWords convention
    "N999",  # Invalid module name
]

"app/extensions/**/PRV_*.py" = ["N801", "N999"]
